## ðŸ“‹ Description

This code implements the experiments in our paper and reproduces the main figures. We compare the performance of:

- **Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD)**  
- **Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PrecGD)**  
- **Gradient Descent (GD)**  

## ðŸ§ª Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2022b or later (earlier versions may also work)
- No additional toolboxes are required
